							I usually like to plan out what I want a website to look like before I make it, either
							sketching it in a notebook or drawing it in a vector graphics program. This site is really
							simple so I figured I'd just kinda start making it and see what happens. I knew from the
							start that I wanted this to be distinct from
							<a class="link" href="https://elijahcirioli.com" target="_blank">my other site</a> which
							meant that it definitely had to be dark themed and I would need to stay far away from the
							color green. A lot of my sites are usually very boring with a big colored rectangle at the
							top and then all the content displayed vertically beneath it. I think that's a super
							functional design but for this I wanted to do something more visually appealing.
							<br /><br />
							The design I came up to fit all these criteria with started the little mountain range. I
							figured that would be more interesting than just a rectangle and I personally think it looks
							really cool. I could have faked it by making it all an image but I decided I would try to do
							a half-decent job. I drew all the different layers of mountains as .svg images so they are
							infinitely scalable. Those images then mask divs of different colors which are layered on
							top of one another. This means that it will look good at any resolution and I can also
							recolor the mountain range however I want using CSS (maybe I’ll add a day/night cycle or
							something). I thought that a yellow would contrast nicely with the shades of blue I had
							chosen and act as a nice accent color. I don’t know if people would consider this to hurt
							the dark theme aspect of the site but I’m not too concerned about that.
							<br /><br />
							The other aspect of the site is the actual content. I don’t really know what I’m talking
							about but I think the concept of “cards” is on the rise with websites. I’m a big fan of the
							CSS flexbox feature and I had messed around with cards a little bit for
							<a class="link" href="https://elijahcirioli.com/micro/" target="_blank"
								>a page on my other site</a
							>
							so I thought I would make a sort of card carousel to display little teasers of each project
							and then if you want to see more they can take your to their own page. While I was looking
							for the <a class="link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> page
							for flexboxes again I stumbled upon the website
							<a class="link" href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">CSS-tricks</a>. They have
							some cards on their site that kind of overlap with each other like a real deck of cards. I
							decided to steal this idea even though it is definitely less functional than just having all
							the cards next to each other. You have to admit it does looks pretty cool. <br /><br />The
							animation of the cards isn’t that complicated. They have negative margins and box shadows on
							one side to give the illusion that they’re in a stack. When you hover the mouse it moves up
							and I used the CSS not selector to move all the other cards out of the way. I think cards
							are pretty cool and I’m sure I’ll use them again but I probably won’t end up doing this kind
							of stacking effect again. It’s certainly form over function but I guess that’s sort of been
							a theme of this site. <br /><br />
							I had never used the CSS mask feature before, but it seems like you can really do a lot with
							it. I think I’m definitely gonna end up doing something with that in the future but I’m not
							sure exactly what. At least by my own standards I think this website actually came out
							pretty cool. It’s definitely sparse and I think the design may breakdown as it gets more
							cluttered but I imagine my main site would have looked a lot more like this if I had made it
							knowing what I do now.
